## 🐳 Local Docker Registry

I prepared a script called `rocker` (Registry for Docker) to easily create and manage a local Docker registry on your machine. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

See the [Rocker README](https://github.com/ephect-io/docker-image/blob/main/registry/README.md) for detailed instructions on usage and configuration.
