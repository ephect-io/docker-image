## 🐳 Local Docker Registry

I prepared a script called `rocker` (Registry for Docker) to easily create and manage a local Docker registry on your machine. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

See the [Rocker README](./registry/README.md) for detailed instructions on usage and configuration.
